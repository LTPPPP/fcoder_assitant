# Handlers Package Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the logic and implementation of task handlers within a Go package. Each task handler is expected to perform specific actions based on events or commands received in the application.

## Overview

Handlers within a package are responsible for processing incoming events or commands and executing the appropriate actions. This README provides a template structure for creating handlers along with an example implementation.

### Package Structure

- `handlers/`: Directory containing handler functions.
  - `handler.go`: File containing handler functions.
  - `README.md`: Documentation for handlers.

## Handler Template

The following is a template for creating handlers within the package:

```go
package handlers

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo"
)

// NewHandlerName creates a new handler with default settings.
func NewHandlerName() *DiscordMessageHandler {
	return &handler
}

// Setup configures the handler with a Discord session.
func (ms *DiscordMessageHandler) Setup(s *discordgo.Session) {
	// Register an event handler to handle specific actions
	s.AddHandler(func(s *discordgo.Session, m *discordgo.MessageCreate) {
		// Logic for handling events or commands
	})
}
